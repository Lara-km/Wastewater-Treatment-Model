1.0 Introduction

This ReadMe file explains the corrsesponding python code found in the code.py file. To do this the below will outline how to run the code, the numerical methods applied and the design choices. 
The code, models the teriatry stage of a wastewater treatment plant to determine the optimal chlorine dosage to produce effleuent with low pollutant concentration. In this, mutiple ODEs show the behavoir of the system, rootfinding numerical methods are applied, and regression modelling shows trend results.
