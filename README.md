What each file does

File code.py is where the whole code is implemented. Brief description of the whole code including why and how Euler and bisection methods that were used, what to do if a secondary internal decay term is added. Below are what inputs, dependencies and outputs will show.

How to run the code

Paste the code in file code.py in virtual environment. (eg. Spyder or VS-code) and click run button.

Three required numerical methods implementation

Euler method.
Solve for coupled dynamics of pollutant and chlorine concentrations ODE in a continuous flow reactor.

Bisection method.
Aim for the root-finding, return root(float), midpoint(list): Root estimation and midpoints for every iteration.

Newton-Raphson method.
Solve for f(x)=0.
