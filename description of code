Description:
Simulates pollutant decay in a reactor with chlorine dosing.
Uses Euler’s method for ODEs and the bisection method to find 
optimal chlorine input.

After finding the optimal chlorine dosage, calculates the
time required to reach the target pollutant concentration
if a secondary internal decay term is added.
